		<h2>Great Resources That Can Be Used To Make (Or Help Make) Visual Novels</h2>
		
		<p>Okay, so you want to make a visual novel (look at you, big shot!)? Well, you can't just go and make one without any resources so here are nine different websites and pieces of software that have been helpful for me personally. I'm going to go rapid fire mode and say about a sentence for each since it's a lot more beneficial for you to check each one out on your own! So, in order alphabetical order, Internet Archive: great for finding old pieces of software or just about anything really. Audacity: Audio editor, great for trimming sounds and the like. Konwerter: Good for converting to different sound formats, has some extra options too. Befunky: Amazing online photo editor, almost everything you need is in the free version. Itch.io: Has visual novels, and you can buy visual novel assets, superb. Ren'Py: A version of python (kind of) used specifically to make visual novels, absolutely incredible. Spriters Resource: Great for getting, well, sprites if you would like to make a fan novel. Khinsider: Has visual novel music; once again great for making fan novels. VNDB: Has a database of almost every VN out there, exploring it is great for coming up with ideas.</p>
