			<h4>Number 5: Doki Doki Literature Club</h4>
			<a href="https://teamsalvato.itch.io/ddlc" target="_blank"><img src="images/ddlc.png" alt="Cover for the visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club" class="round center spin"></a>
			
			<!-- &emsp is a four space tab character -->
			<p>&emsp; Doki Doki Literature Club takes number 5 on the list and that's for a good reason. Despite it's seemingly bland concept of just a visual novel dating simulator featuring the four girls Monika, Sayori, Natsuki and Yuri and their, well, literature club, it is much, much more than that. I won't say too much as I'm here to get you to play these games and not to spoil them, but this is a warning you will get when you first boot up the game. This game touches on some heavy topics and has depictions of violence. Appearances sure can be deceiving. Other things to note about this visual novel is that it's short which is nice for beginners as a lot of the more traditional ones can get pretty up there in length, especially if you're going for every ending. Speaking of endings, this VN does have multiple, but it is fairly linear, another good thing for beginners or people who don't want to deal with insanely complex dialogue and choice trees. This visual novel also has a lot of fan games which is really rare for this kind of media, so it's very easy to get more content if you like the game. Another good thing is that this game is free! There is a paid version with more content named <a href="https://ddlc.plus/" target="_blank">Doki Doki Literature Club Plus</a> but the free version is still a full on game. With all that said, this still isn't for everyone due to some of the heavier content, and it's fair from traditional in the visual novel world, so that's why it's only number 5.</p>

			<h4>Number 4: Coffee Talk</h4>
			<a href="https://togeproductions.itch.io/coffee-talk" target="_blank"><img src="images/coffee.png" alt="Cover for the visual novel Coffee Talk" class="round center spin"></a>
			<p>&emsp; Coffee Talk! This is probably the coziest visual novel, heck, the coziest game out there! You take the role of a nameless barista serving up coffee in a futuristic fantasy version of Seattle, listening to the many problems and stories of your customers! The location, the music, the art, everything about this visual novel is just comfortable and evokes a warm and welcoming feeling. And, even through this is a visual novel at it's core, it is different in one major way. In most visual novels, you get different endings and dialogue based off the choices you make when talking to characters. That's not as such here. The way you get different endings and whatnot is actually based on what you serve your customers! For example, a customer may come in and say they want something sweet. Now, you can give them something bitter, something sweet or even their favourite drink if you're using a guide or have played the game before! There's an infinite amount of options and even if every one doesn't produce a different result, there are still many, many choices. And that example is just for one customer on one day. There's certainly more than customers and this visual novel takes place over about two weeks of time, so there's plenty of chances to fool around with coffee choices and bond with the characters! This still is short for a visual novel, but it's longer than the previous one on this list, and it definitely doesn't feel short! Because of that though, this isn't a free VN, but it's very reasonably priced at 16.99 CAD and I often see it go on sale for the US price of 12.99. It also has a <a href="https://togeproductions.itch.io/coffee-talk-demo" target="_blank">demo version</a> if you want to try it out as well. The last thing to mention is that if you read this VN and want more, it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663220/Coffee_Talk_Episode_2_Hibiscus__Butterfly/" target="_blank">sequel</a> that came out pretty recently at the time of writing this! This is a solid pick, but it only gets better from here!</p>

			<h4>Number 3: Tsukihime</h4>
			<a href="https://www.readtsukihi.me/" target="_blank"><img src="images/hime.png" alt="Cover for the visual novel Tsukihime" class="round center spin"></a>
			<p>&emsp; Tsukihime, Lunar Legend Tsukihime, Tsukihime Lunar Legend, Shingetsutan Tsukihime, Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon-, what ever you want to call this visual novel, it is one of the all-time greats. You follow the young man Shiki Tohno, cursed with the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception as well as his very own Tohno blood, he has an encounter with the True Ancestor (the purest form of vampire) known as Arcueid Brunestud. From there, it depends on what route you take and what character you decide to spend most of your time with. Being released in the millennium year 2000, it's a much more traditional visual novel, having you make choices and depending on what choices you make depend on what ending you get. Speaking of, there are a lot of endings for you to go for. There are 5 characters you can follow, The vampire Arcueid, the church member (aka the vampire hunter) Ciel, the head of the Tohno estate Akiha, the Tohno family maid Hisui and the sister of Hisui and other Tohno family maid, Kohaku. Of them, each has a bad end and a true end making 10. Then, Arcueid, Ciel and Hisui all have true endings. And finally, Akiha has two normal endings making for a total of 15 endings, so there's <i>a lot</i> to do here! Not to mention the little Easter eggs and variations on the bad endings! And I haven't even gotten to the best part yet, this visual novel is abandonware meaning that you <i>have</i> to play it for free unless you find one of the 100 some odd discs of it still floating around... And those won't be in English. But I'm still not done, this visual novel has recently been ported to <a href="https://holofield.fr/tsukiweb/title" target="_blank"><i>web browser</i></a> and it's the best way to read this VN since it can skip past all of the no-no parts, that were so commonly added to visual novels at the time just to increase sales! And guess what? There's even <i>more</i>! There's a <a href="https://tsukihime-en.com/" target="_blank">remake</a> that came out a few years ago, but it's coming to the west in 2024 for modern consoles! Although, it is paid for... Not that it matters because if you want more Tsukihime, it has two semi-sequels called Tsukihime PLUS-DISK and Kagetsu Tohya that are <i>also</i> free and can be downloaded <a href="https://www.readtsukihi.me/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>. I have way too many things I want to say, but I think I've said just about enough for this novel, personally it's my second favourite, but I'm trying to look at this from a newcomers' perspective. So, finally, on to number two!</p>

			<h4>Number 2: Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations</h4>
			<a href="https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Trials_and_Tribulations" target="_blank"><img src="images/aa3.png" alt="Cover for the visual novel Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations" class="round center spin"></a>
			<p>&emsp; Here we are, the cream of the crop of visual novels for non-visual novel fans. Without spoiling the next thing on this list, it's best described as the pure visual novel experience. But this, this is different in the best way possible. You play as defense attorney Phoenix Wright in his third outing. Yes, this is the third game in a series but it's so much better than the first two games that I had to put it here. But, fret not! The start of this visual novel does have a small recap of sorts describing the characters. Though it's probably best if you read the others first since they're still amazing (even better than some of the VNs on this list, but I wanted to have a limit of one VN per series). Either way, this is the most game-like visual novel because, since you're a lawyer, you have to collect evidence to defend you clients in court! You have weed out contradictions and present evidence to do so this really ends up being the perfect storm of visual novel and puzzle game. Because of its unique format, it's linear in the way that there's only one ending. Every case you take on is all building to one major ending that would be impossible if there were multiple routes. There are "bad endings" per se, but they're closer to game over states rather than actual endings. I don't want to spoil too much since one of the great joys of this visual novel is figuring out the puzzle of whom the real killer is per case, so I'd give this one of my highest recommendations! This is another paid for VN, but it goes on sale a lot (it's currently on sale at the time of writing this!) and the best way to buy it is in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/787480/Phoenix_Wright_Ace_Attorney_Trilogy/" target="_blank">Ace Attorney Trilogy</a> since it comes with the other two previous VNs and is on every modern console. Plus, it's not just those three, if you like this series there are 3 more mainline visual novels and 5 spinoffs. So that's 10 total to enjoy if you really end up liking this series as much as I do (I've gone through 9 of the 10 so far!). The characters all feel like real people despite their often ridiculous personalities and even more ridiculous appearances! The stories touch on many themes like loss, importance of family, what's important to you and just about everything under the sun all written spectacularly! All in all great VN, great series, great everything! But, there is one more, one more visual novel that is the pinnacle of its medium. It's time to go onto numero uno!</p>

			<h4>Number 1: Clannad</h4>

			<!-- &frac12 is the 1/2 symbol character -->
			<p>&emsp; This is my favourite visual novel of all time, the anime adaptation is my favourite anime of all time, the anime movie is... alright (hey, everything can't be perfect). Let's start with some basic stuff. The visual novel is loooooong. 60 hours! 60 whole hours! And that's just for the main story, assuming you go for the bare minimum! According to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/1736" target="_blank">howlongtobeat.com</a> it's 84&frac12; hours if you go for every ending! So what do those many hours of reading entail? Well, you follow Tomoya Okazaki, a high school student and delinquent of sorts. Because of his family situation, he just wades through life without much thought put into it. That is until he meets Nagisa Furukawa, a person who has undoubtedly more troubles than Tomoya who finds the urge to help her as despite his demeanor, he really is a nice person at heart. Just like with Tsukihime, it all depends from there. Though, now there are about a dozen people who have routes. Although, it's only ending per person and one generic bad ending. Everything I've said for Ace Attorney goes 10x for this visual novel (except for maybe the wacky appearances). The themes are immaculately woven into the stories, the characters feel like real people you could meet, the music ranges from silly times with friends to otherworldly ethereal. It can do everything, it makes you cry, laugh, cheer, angry, it's perfect. If every word on this page was about this visual novel it still wouldn't be enough to describe how powerful the stories told here are. If you want to experience them for yourself it is a bit expensive but well worth it considering you get (at minimum) 60 hours of time out of it. Even if you don't want to spend that much, the anime is probably the best adaptation of a visual novel full stop. I want to say so so so so so so so much! But I don't want to ruin the experience for a potential reader. If you had to pick one to read of these 5 this is <i>the</i> one!</p>
