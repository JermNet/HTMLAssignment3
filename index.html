			<h2>What Are Visual Novels? (What You Need To Know)</h2>
			
			<p>So, before you go look around what I think are the more fun pages of this website, I think you may want to know what a visual novel actually is. A visual novel is like a game, kind of... Visual novels are like games with less stuff but books with more stuff. Yeah, that may sound confusing, but it really isn't, I just need to explain it a little better. Most visual novels take place from a first-person perspective where you "play" as a character with a text box taking up part of the screen over a background with music. Most of the "gameplay" is reading a story of any type just like a <i>novel</i> with <i>visuals</i> (see what I did there haha?). That's not all they are though! One of the main appeals of the visual novel format is the choose your own adventure style. You'll go through a VN (short for visual novel if that wasn't clear) and then boom! A choice! The choices you make depend on what ending you get, what characters you meet, what story beats take place and don't etc. And it can get COMPLICATED! There are VNs that have entire choice trees just for one section of a story or to get just one simple ending. One of the other appeals of visual novels are the things that make them a lot less like visual novels haha. Sure, visual novels are going to be enjoyable to people who like reading, but how do you make them appeal to people who don't? Gimmicks! If your visual novel is mystery oriented then maybe add some puzzles. If your main character is interested in games then maybe have them play one, you know? Overall, visual novels are novels choose your own adventure books, video games and a little secret spice to tie everything together. So, since you know what I'm talking about (at least, I hope so) why don't you go check out some of the other pages? There's three of them, and they look pretty good if you ask me! You know you want to!</p>
