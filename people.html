		<h2>Three Important People In The World Of Visual Novels</h2>
		<p>
			Now that you know more about visual novels, there's a very clear next step (at least to me) and that's to learn about the people behind them! There's a crazy amount of work that goes into each and every visual novel, big or small and I think it's important to appreciate some of the people behind them! I'll try and make this quick by only talking about three people. But, as you probably know, there are many, many, many people that go behind even one section of one visual novel. If I were to talk about all the people who worked on my favourite visual novels, well, let's just say that this assignment would be well past due. Anyway, on to the people (in no particular order because it would be weird to rank people)!

				Jun Maeda, born in 1975, as his life went on he found interest in video games and music, so it was natural that he wanted to be a video game composer. He shot for big companies such as <i>Capcom</i> and <i>Namco</i> but ended up unsuccessful. Although not as big as the two mentioned, he got an interview for the video game developer <i>TGL</i> but, due to not being able to give the correct documentation, that venture was unsuccessful as well. At that point, he was a big fed up and decided in a change of occupation as a visual novel writer. And since they were what sold at the time, in one month he wrote a 300-page erotic story that he attempted to sell to <i>AliceSoft</i>, the company known for <i>Rance</i>, a popular erotic visual novel series. That didn't work out either but in 1997 he finally got work at the company <i>Scoop</i> as a VN writer. He quit after he finished writing his first one due the work environment. He worked and quit at one more company before forming his own company <i>Key</i> under the publisher <i>VisualArts</i>. Not only that, but he finally got to compose music for the visual novel <i>Kanon</i> (on top of writing it!) which turned out to be extremely popular. After that, the rest was history. Almost every VN made by <i>Key</i> was popular and Jun Maeda wrote for and composed all of them aside from one. Although he enjoyed his time at <i>Key</i>, he eventually quit and composed full time for different anime series which he has done as recently as 2022.

			<h4>Dan Salvato</h4>

				Born on December 23, 1991, Dan Salvato had much less of a history than Jun Maeda. Before he developed and released his break-out visual novel <i>Doki Doki Literature Club</i>, Mr. Salvato was a professional <i>Super Smash Brothers</i> (a fighting game featuring many <i>Nintendo</i> characters as well as some characters from other companies) player from New Jersey. In fact, he was one of the best players (if not, the best) who used the character Link from the US. He also developed the most popular mod for the Super Smash Brothers series <i>Project M</i>. He retired from the professional scene not long after that in 2015. It is likely that he started development of DDLC not long after as he intended to release the game on April 1st 2017 (although it would get delayed to September 22nd of the same year) and the VN became a smash hit. It was also the first to be popular among a wider audience that was developed by someone outside of Japan. Since then, Dan The Man Salvato has released an updated version in 2021 titled <i>Doki Doki Literature Club Plus</i> and that's been it so far. It is unknown if he plans or is working on another project, but I certainly hope he is!

				Not much is known about Shu Takumi before he joined the video game company Capcom in 1994 other than his birthday (May 2, 1971). He worked there for quite a few years working on games such as <i>Gakkou no Kowai Uwasa: Hanako-san ga Kita!!</i>, <i>Dino Crisis</i> and the sequel <i>Dino Crisis 2</i>. At some point during this time he had come up with a detective game but nothing came of it at first. Then, after the release of DC2 a small team was formed of only two programmers, two graphical asset developers and Shu Takumi who was tasked with the roles of planner, director, and writer. After deciding to use Takumi's detective idea and a change pf hardware from the <i>Game Boy Color</i> to the more powerful <i>Game Boy Advance</i> everything was decided, and it was time to get to work! Over an astonishingly short period of 10 months the visual novel developed into <i>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</i>. After that, it was a blur, getting Shu Takumi to develop two more Ace Attorney's then a fourth one and three spin-offs. He would also develop the game <i>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</i>. His most recent work was on <i>Monster Hunter Riders</i> as a writer in 2020. Although he is still active on the in video game and visual novel world.
